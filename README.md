Project Description:

This project showcases the required standards for password complexity based on the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). It adheres to the following password criteria:

Passwords must adhere to at least three out of four complexity rules:
Include at least one uppercase character (A-Z).
Include at least one lowercase character (a-z).
Contain at least one digit (0-9).
Incorporate at least one special character (punctuation), including treating space as a special character.
Passwords must be a minimum of 10 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.
The project also enforces the rule against having more than two identical characters consecutively (e.g., "111" is not allowed).

These standards are implemented within a graphical user interface developed using Python, providing a user-friendly platform for evaluating password strength against OWASP's recommended criteria.

Summary:

This project is a password strength checker GUI application developed using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to input a password and assesses its strength based on seven different criteria. These criteria include length, numeric count, presence of uppercase characters, presence of  lowercase characters, and presence of special characters. The application provides immediate feedback to users about the strength of their password, highlighting weaknesses such as insufficient length, lack of character diversity, or consecutive identical characters. It helps users create stronger passwords based on the OWASP standards by guiding them on what elements to include for enhanced security. Overall, the project offers a user-friendly interface for evaluating password strength, promoting better cybersecurity practices among users.
